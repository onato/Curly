Keep you service organised by project so you always know where they are and you don't have to remember long parameter queries. 

Often when we begin a project we deal a lot with web-services. After we get the communication working we tend to forget about the details. Organising you web-service in Curly means you will pick up right where you left off when it comes to update your API calls.

Organising your API calls be project has the added benefit of being able to test all your web-services like a test suite.
