Export your services as curl commands so you can easily share them. To monitor them and protect yourself from service changes export them to be run by the Curly Test Runner.

###Export as curl
{% highlight bash %}
    curl --request POST --data 'email=onato.com@gmail.com&type=note&title=Curly Alert&body=One of your services failed!' -H 'Authorization: Bearer eHUemjHKPMnbqhvaQvu6GF6iRW5yTTNr' https://api.pushbullet.com/v2/pushes -i
{% endhighlight %}

###Export for Monitoring

A script like the one below can be generated that contains the details of your service plus the verification script for insuring correctness. This can be run by the Curly Test Runner which will send a push notification to your devices through the Pushbullet service. This way you will get word as soon as a server goes down or a colleague applies a breaking change.
        
{% highlight ruby %}

require('should')
var curly = require('curly');
describe('Curly', function(){
  it('403', function(done){
    var service = {url:'http://development.onato.com/curly/403.php', json:true};
    curly.request(service, function(statusCode, statusCodeString, contentType, response, responseString, headers){
    
    
    statusCode.should.be.exactly(4030);
    statusCodeString.should.be.exactly("forbidden");
    responseString.should.match(/.*denied.*/);
    response.should.containDeep({"message" : "access denied"});
    
    
    done();
  });
});
â€¦
