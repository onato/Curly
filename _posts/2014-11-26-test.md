Verify the reponse of a service using [should.js](https://github.com/shouldjs/should.js#example "Should.js"). Run a suite of API tests at the press of a button.

Who hasn't had a webservice change on them? Adding varification enables you to see right away if all your services are online and working the way you expect them to.

For more information on [should.js](https://github.com/shouldjs/should.js#example "Should") syntax take a look at their [assertions documentation](https://github.com/shouldjs/should.js#assertions "Should.js Ssertions Documentation").

###Example:

{% highlight javascript %}
Should(statusCode).be.exactly(200);
response.should.be.an.instanceOf(Array);
response.should.have.length(1);
{% endhighlight %}
